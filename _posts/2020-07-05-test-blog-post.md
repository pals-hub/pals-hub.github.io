title: "Gibbs Phenomenon in OFDM Systems"

Many factors contribute to the error vector magnitude of received symbols in OFDM communication systems. One of the more subtle ones among those has to do with a combination of Gibbs Phenomenon under certain channel conditions. In this blog post, we would motivate the concepts on which OFDM systems operate, work our way towards understanding the impact of Gibbs Phenomenon and the associated concept of Symbol-Timing Adjustment to mitigate this effect in Test &amp; Measurement.
